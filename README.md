# EGGLISH
If you're bored with talking in English and want something new, try speaking in Egglish!

## English -> Egglish: words with 3 or more letters
Translating a word is easy!

`Code` -> `Codegge`
1. Remove the last letter
2. Add "egg"
3. Add the last letter back

`Bruh` -> `Brueggeh`
1. Remove the last letter
2. Add "egge"
3. Add the last letter back

**Note:** use the 2nd method when the word does NOT end with a vowel

## English -> Egglish: words with less than 3 letters

`I` -> `Ig`
1. Add a "g"

`Is` -> `Iseg`
1. Add an "eg"

**Note:** use the 2nd method when the word does NOT end with a vowel

## Exceptions

- if a word ends with "y", it is counted as a vowel

## Contractions

`Isn't` -> `Iseggen't`
`Won't` -> `Woeggen't`
`I'm` -> `Ig'm`

In contractions you treat the left side as if it were a single word and add the right side after translating it
